# Hardware

Robots that are trainable by humans. Each implementation uses the [Fido library](https://github.com/FidoProject/Fido) for its learning model and the cross-platform [Fido training app](https://github.com/FidoProject/TrainingApp) to recieve positive and negative feedback from humans. Experimental results from these two robots are published in the [Research repository](https://github.com/FidoProject/Research).

## Thing One

This was the first physical robot that used the Fido library. Previously, the library had been tested on its robotic simulator. "Thing One," as it is called, is powered by an Intel Edison and uses a differential drive system with two wheels. The robot is enclosed in a 3d printed case. Thing One utilizes a wide array of sensors, including an IMU, a light sensor, and a sound pressure sensor.
